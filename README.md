# FlappyBird

Just a simplified Flappy Bird game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Instructions:
Load the flappy.html file on your web browser.
Press any key on your keyboard to gain height, release it to drop it.
The more pipe walls your bird crosses, more points you score.
If your bird collides to any pipe wall, hit F5 and try again.

Have fun. ;D
